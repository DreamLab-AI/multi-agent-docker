A sophisticated, containerized development platform that integrates the **Claude Flow** orchestration engine with a suite of **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** tools and external application bridges. This environment is designed for building and testing complex, AI-driven development workflows.

## üìö Project Documentation

This project's documentation is organized into several key documents:

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| üöÄ **[Quick Start Guide](./QUICKSTART.md)** | The fastest way to get the environment up and running. **Start here!** |
| üèóÔ∏è **[Architecture Overview](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** | A detailed breakdown of the system's components and data flows. |
| ü§ñ **[Agent Technical Briefing](./AGENT-BRIEFING.md)** | Technical documentation for AI agents operating within this environment. |

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Unified Tool Orchestration**: Uses `claude-flow` to manage all tools via a standardized `stdio` protocol.
- **External Application Bridges**: Provides MCP-to-TCP bridges to connect with external applications like Blender and QGIS.
- **Comprehensive Toolset**: Pre-configured tools for image processing, 3D modeling, circuit design, and geospatial analysis.
- **Modern Development Stack**: Includes Python 3.12, Node.js 22+, Rust, and Deno runtimes.
- **Clean & Extensible Architecture**: A clear separation between background services and on-demand, stateless tools.
