# Waste Code and Redundancy Analysis

This document identifies potential areas of waste, redundancy, and code that could be cleaned up or refactored to improve the maintainability of the project.

## 1. Redundant Docker Compose Files

-   **File**: [`gui-based-tools-docker/docker-compose-multi-agent.yml`](gui-based-tools-docker/docker-compose-multi-agent.yml)
-   **File**: [`gui-based-tools-docker/docker-compose.yml`](gui-based-tools-docker/docker-compose.yml)
-   **Reasoning**: The project has a primary `docker-compose.yml` at the root. These additional compose files in a subdirectory are likely outdated or were used for development purposes. They can create confusion and should be removed in favor of the single, authoritative root compose file.

## 2. Old Networking Documentation

-   **File**: [`gui-based-tools-docker/NETWORKING-SETUP.md`](gui-based-tools-docker/NETWORKING-SETUP.md)
-   **File**: [`gui-based-tools-docker/README-NETWORKING.md`](gui-based-tools-docker/README-NETWORKING.md)
-   **Reasoning**: These files appear to be older versions of the networking documentation. The creation of the new, comprehensive `NETWORKING.md` at the root level makes these files redundant. They should be removed to avoid conflicting or outdated information.

## 3. Tessellating PBR Generator Sub-project

-   **Directory**: [`gui-based-tools-docker/tessellating-pbr-generator/`](gui-based-tools-docker/tessellating-pbr-generator/)
-   **Reasoning**: This directory contains a full-fledged Python project with its own tests, documentation, and output files. While the PBR generator is a valuable tool, including its entire development history and test suite within this repository adds significant clutter.
-   **Recommendation**: The `tessellating-pbr-generator` should be extracted into its own separate Git repository. The `gui-tools-docker/Dockerfile` can then be updated to clone this repository and install it, keeping the main project much cleaner.

## 4. Duplicate MCP Tool Directories

-   **Directory**: `mcp-configs/`
-   **Directory**: `mcp-scripts/`
-   **Directory**: `mcp-tools/`
-   **Reasoning**: These directories at the root level appear to be duplicates of the directories found within `core-assets`. The `setup-workspace.sh` script copies files from `core-assets` into the workspace, which might explain the duplication. However, having these directories in the root of the repository is confusing.
-   **Recommendation**: Verify if these root-level directories are used for any part of the build or runtime process. If not, they should be removed from the repository to enforce `core-assets` as the single source of truth.
